        We will be able to provide financial support through an NSF Conference grant to some of the participants.
        The support will be primarily directed towards PhD students, early career researchers, and 
        members of underrepresented groups in mathematics.
        <p class="mt-2">
        To request financial support and/or give a contributed 20-minute talk, please:
        <ul>
            <li>

            <li>
                The deadline for contributed talk requests is also January 25, 2024. Should your talk be
                selected by the local organizational committee, you will be informed together with your financial support request in early February, 2024.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are a PhD candidate, please have your advisor send a short
                recommendation letter (1 page limit)
                to {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="wbt4qn" %} or {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="yq2dw" %}

<h2 class="mb-3">Recommended conference hotel </h2>

The department of Mathematics at Unversity of Virginia has negotiated a special conference pricing at the <a href="https://englishinncharlottesville.com/">English Inn of Charlottesville</a> for the workshop participants. A special discounted price of $159 per night
in double queen rooms has been confirmed for our workshop. In addition, shuttle services to our conference venue from the hotel will be provided free of charge. In order to make reservations at the English Inn, please 
 all the Front Desk (434-971-9900 EXT#0) and mention our workshop "Quantum Structures in Lie Theory" to make reservations. You will need to book with your own funds, and, if you are receiving support from us, be
reimbursed by North Carolina State University later with proper receipts. We recommend junior <a href="{{site.url}}/ims/workshop-spring-2024/participants">participants</a> to pair up, if you can, and utilize this special 
hotel pricing.
<br>
Please be aware of scam emails pretending to be conference organizers making hotel reservations for you. We will not be contacting participants for your payment information, and you should be making your own reservations 
unless you are a main speaker.
