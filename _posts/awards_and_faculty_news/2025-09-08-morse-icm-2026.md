Mathematics professor {% include person_info_just_name.html UVA_id="jlm6cj" %} will be an invited speaker at the [International Congress of Mathematicians](https://www.icm2026.org/event/ac193975-5d24-4628-8c30-ddb23de19a8b/speakers) in Philadelphia in July 2026. Held every four years, the ICM is the premier mathematics conference in the world and is the setting for the awarding of the Gauss Prize, the Chern Medal, the IMU Abacus Medal, and the Fields Medal.

A [new UVA Arts & Sciences article](https://as.virginia.edu/mathematician-jennifer-morse-selected-speak-worlds-most-prestigious-math-conference) highlights how Professor Morse is being recognized for her groundbreaking work in algebraic combinatorics, including solving a problem she first encountered over 20 years ago as a graduate student.

Professor Morse's work focuses on algebraic combinatorics, a field that connects patterns and counting techniques to the deep structures underlying mathematics and physics.

"Jennifer Morse is a world expert in symmetric functions and the combinatorial aspects of partitions," said Ken Ono, UVA's STEM Advisor to the Provost and Marvin Rosenblum Professor of Mathematics. "Her invitation to speak at the ICM is a huge honor and reflects her exceptional standing in the field."

Morse's research has pushed the boundaries of algebraic combinatorics for more than two decades. After more than 20 years of sustained work and collaboration, she and her colleagues recently cracked one of the central problems she first encountered as a graduate student.

In addition to the ICM invitation, Professor Morse has recently been named a Fellow of both the American Mathematical Society and the Simons Foundation â€” significant honors that speak to the influence of her research.
