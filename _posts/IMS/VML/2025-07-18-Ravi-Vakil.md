<h2>Lecture 1: The Mathematics of Doodling</h2>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, September 8, 2025 | 5-6pm<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Wilson 402<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Doodling is a creative and fundamentally human activity, resulting in doodles with intricate and often hidden implicit structure. We will treat doodles as an example for how mathematics is done â€” by starting with some doodles, we will ask ourselves some natural questions and see where they take us. They will lead us to some unexpected places, and to some sophisticated mathematics.</p>

<h2>Lecture 2: Topology from Algebraic Geometry</h2>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, September 9, 2025 | 5-6pm<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Wilson 402<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> One of the magical parts of being a mathematician is seeing how different fields of mathematics are intertwined. Sometimes a surprising fact in one field comes from an insight in another. I will give some examples of the philosophy that when geometry comes from algebra or arithmetic, the topology can be unexpectedly constrained, which lets you prove results by "cutting and pasting". I will conclude by trying to indicate how Bott periodicity (which I won't assume you understand) is a fact about algebra, not analysis. I will discuss work of a number of mathematicians, including Melanie Wood, Aaron Landesman, Hannah Larson, Jim Bryan, and more. (This talk is intended as a survey for a broad audience.)</p>
